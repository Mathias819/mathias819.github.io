<div class="Post">
Finally able to get Jekyll installed locally on my laptop.  Still trying to figure out Git/Github/Jekyll.
Using Git GUI for now, but will attempt to use command line soon.

I would like to give thanks to <a href="http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/1-ruby-and-devkit/">Jekyll</a>
for a great walk through.  This allowed me to install Jekyll and get the ball rolling.
